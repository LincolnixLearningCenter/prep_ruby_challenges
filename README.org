* Ruby Calisthenics

** Power
   
   Write a method /power/ which takes two integers (/base/ and /exponent/) and 
   returns the /base/ raised to the power of /exponent/. Do not use Ruby's "**"
   operator for this!

   #+begin_src ruby
     > power(3,4)
     => 81 # (3*3*3*3)
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src ruby
     def power(base,exponent)
       # returns base raised to the power of exponent without the use of ** operator
       
       a = base
       b = exponent
       c = []

       b.times do
         c.push a
       end

       #c.inject(0) {|d,e| d*e}
       c.inject(1) {|product, n| product * n}
     end

     power(2,3)

   #+end_src
