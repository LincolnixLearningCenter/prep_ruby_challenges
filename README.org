* Ruby Calisthenics

** Power
   
   Write a method /power/ which takes two integers (/base/ and /exponent/) and 
   returns the /base/ raised to the power of /exponent/. Do not use Ruby's "**"
   operator for this!

   : > power(3,4)
   : => 81 # (3*3*3*3)

   #+begin_src ruby :tangle power.rb
     def power(base,exponent)
       # returns base raised to the power of exponent without the use of ** operator
       
       a = base
       b = exponent
       c = []

       b.times do
         c.push a
       end

       p c.inject(1) {|product, n| product * n}
     end

     power(3,4)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 81

** Factorial
   
   Write a method /factorial/ which takes a number and returns the product of 
   every number up to the current number multiplied together.

   : > factorial(5)
   : => 120 # from 1*2*3*4*5

   #+begin_src ruby :tangle factorial.rb
     def factorial(n)
       # Int => Int
       # Takes a number and returns the product of every number up to 
       # the current number multiplied together

       a = []

       n.downto(1).each do |i|
         a.push i
       end

       p a.inject(1) {|product, n| product * n}

     end

     factorial(5)
   #+end_src 

   #+RESULTS:
   : 120

** Uniques

   Write a method /uniques/ which takes an array of items and returns the array
   without any duplicates. Don't use Ruby's /uniq/ method.

   : uniques([1,5,"frog",2,1,3,"frog"])
   : => [1,5,"frog",2,3]

   #+begin_src ruby :tangle uniques.rb
     def uniques(array)
       # Array of Items => Array of Items
       # Takes an array, returns array with duplicate items removed.
       # Write without uniq

       no_dupes = []
       couples = array.combination(2)
       groups = array.group_by{|e| e}

       groups.each do |g|
         no_dupes.push(g[0])
       end

       p no_dupes
     end

     uniques([1,5,"frog",2,1,3,"frog"])
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   | 1 | 5 | frog | 2 | 3 |

** Combinations

   Write a method /combinations/ which takes two arrays of strings and returns
   an array with all of the combinations of the items in them, listing the first
   items first.

   : > combinations(["on","in"],["to","rope"])
   : => ["onto","onrope","into","inrope"]

   #+begin_src ruby :tangle combinations.rb
     def combinations(ary1,ary2)
       # Ary(Str), Ary(Str) => Ary(Str)
       # Takes two arrays of strings, returns an array with all of the combinations
       # of the items in them, listing the first item first.

       a = ary1
       b = ary2

       c = []
       
       a.each do |s|
         b.each do |x|
           c.push "#{s}#{x}"
         end
       end

       p c
     end

     combinations(["on","in"],["to","rope"])
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   | onto | onrope | into | inrope |

** Primes

   Write a method /is_prime?/ which takes in a number and returns /true/ if it 
   is a prime number.

   : > is_prime?(7)
   : => true
   : > is_prime?(14)
   : => false

   #+begin_src ruby :tangle primes.rb
     def is_prime?(i)
       range = (i-1).downto(2)

       range.each do |a|
         #p i%a == 0
       end

       p range.any? {|a| i%a == 0}
     end

     is_prime?(7)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : true

** Rectangle Overlap  

   Write a method /overlap/ which takes two rectangles defined by the 
   coordinates of their corners, e.g. /[[0,0],[3,3]]/ and /[[1,1],[4,6]]/,
   and determines whether they overlap. You can assume all coordinates are 
   positive integers.

   : > overlap( [ [0,0],[3,3] ], [ [1,1],[4,5] ] )
   : => true
   : > overlap( [ [0,0],[1,4] ], [ [1,1],[3,2] ] )
   : => false 

   It doesn't count as overlapping if their edges touch but they do not 
   otherwise overwrite each other. As expressed by a sixth grade student:

   [[./coordinate_overlaps.png]]

   #+begin_src ruby :tangle overlap.rb
     def overlap(a,b)
       # Array(Coordinates), Array(Coordinates) => Boolean
       
       # a = [[0,0],[3,3]]
       ax1 = a[0][0]
       ay1 = a[0][1] 
       ax2 = a[1][0]
       ay2 = a[1][1]
       
       awidth = ax2-ax1
       aheight = ay2-ay1
       aarea = awidth*aheight
       
       # b = [[1,1],[4,5]]
       bx1 = b[0][0]
       by1 = b[0][1]
       bx2 = b[1][0]
       by2 = b[1][1]
       
       bwidth = bx2-bx1
       bheight = by2-by1
       barea = bwidth*bheight

       #( [ [0  , 0  ],[3  , 3  ] ], [ [1  , 1  ],[4  , 5  ] ] )
       #( [ [ax1, ay1],[ax2, ay2] ], [ [bx1, by1],[bx2, by2] ] )

       case a
       when bx1 < ax2 && by1 < ay2
         true
       when bx1 < ax2 && by2 > ay1
         true
       when bx2 > ax1 && by2 > ay1
         true
       when ax1 < bx2 && ay2 > by1
         true
       else
         false
       end
     end

     p overlap( [ [0,0],[3,3] ], [ [1,1],[4,5] ] )
     p overlap( [ [0,0],[1,4] ], [ [1,1],[3,2] ] )

* A Bigger Challenge: The Counting Game

  POSITION! INDEX 0-9! (1..10)

  10 friends are sitting in a circle around a table and decide to play a new 
  game. In it, they count up through the numbers from 1 to 100. The first person
  says "1", the second says "2" and so on... but with a few catches:

  - Whenever the number is divisible by 7, they switch directions. So person 6 
    will say "6", person 7 will say "7", then person 6 again will say "8".

    : when x%y == 0 # reverse

  - Whenever the number is divisible by 11, they skip the next person for the 
    following number. For instance, if person 3 says "33", person 5 will say 
    "34" instead (person 4 gets skipped).

    : friends = []
    : 10.times do 
    :   friends.push 0

  Your job is to code a program which outputs each number and which person said 
  it. Use it to show that  player 1 will say the number "100".

  Tips:

  - Remember to stick with brute force instead of trying to "figure out" the 
    trick to the problem.
  - Name your variables well!
  - Ignore the skipping to start out with. Only add it when you're ready.

    
  Advanced Option:

  - Make your method take two inputs -- the number of players and the number 
    you're counting up to. Then see who says the last number each time!
    
    
  

** The Elevator

   You live in a 25 story building with one elevator. The central 
   microcontroller got eaten by rats and the building manager has asked you to 
   code up the elevator's operating procedure until he can get a new one. You 
   figure you'll have to learn to actually code soon but you first want to think
   things through and pseudocode your design.

*** Elevator Details

    The basic elevator machinery is completely dumb (it doesn't do anything it's
    not told to do) but is capable of interpreting and executing the commands:

    - "open elevator door"
    - "close elevator door"
    - "go up full speed"
    - "go down full speed"
    - "slow down"
    - "stop"

      
    ...and it accepts user input in the form of:

    - floor buttons inside the elevator
    - door open and close buttons inside the elevator
    - up and down call buttons on each floor

      
    ...and it has sensors for:

    - if a human is in the door closing path
    - if it is currently at a floor (instead of in-between floors)

      
    ...and it has a few quirky requirements:

    - it must "slow down" at least 1 floor before it stops.
    - there is a small chance that it actually stops between floors by 
      accident (it's an old elevator)

*** The Task

    Your job is to design a properly working elevator. It should stop on each 
    floor it is physically able to during a given trip to pick up whoever is 
    going the same direction. Additionally, make sure that no one is:

    1. smashed into the ground
    2. pushed through the roof
    3. squished by the doors
    4. let off in between floors
    5. stuck going the wrong direction (unless they choose not to exit)

       
    This will be good practice thinking about all the edge cases and scenarios 
    that a user can do.

    The point isn't to follow any strict guidelines of syntax but rather to 
    focus on getting the logic of the problem figured out and then organizing it
    into modules that accomplish the sub-tasks that are required.

    Think about:
    
    - Using a loop around everything to keep your pseudocode (and elevator) 
      running.
    - Writing everything in one giant mess to start with and then refactoring it
      to break apart the modules so it feels less cluttered and messy.

*** Use Modules!

    This exercise is large enough that you will need to break your code up into
    modules. Remember the SOLID lessons -- modules should only have one major 
    purpose. For this exercise, you can use other modules by simply calling 
    their name in plain english and writing them out as separate programs down
    below your main program. They could be groups of procedural instructions 
    like "slow down the elevator if necessary", which runs the 
    "ReachedADestinationFloor?" program.

           - Modules Interface
             - keep modules as independent as practically possible (aim for low "Coupling")
             - make sure modules are all working towards the same goal (are highly "Cohesive")
             - try to keep modules insulated from how other modules actually do 
               their job (keep them highly "Encapsulated")

*** Learning Modularity

    - The 3 Characteristics of Good Modules

      Essentially, there are just three important guidelines for how modules 
      should operate and interact. These high level principles essentially guide
      the theory behind modularity -- it's good to break things into pieces, 
      those pieces shouldn't rely on each other for much, each piece should do 
      its own thing, and pieces should talk to each other using pre-determined
      interfaces.

      Modules should have:

      1. Low Coupling -- they should be minimally dependent on each other and 
         communicate using specified interfaces

         - forcing modules to communicate with each other only by using 
           specified interfaces

      2. High Cohesion -- they should be focused completely on achieving the 
         overall goal

      3. High Encapsulation -- they shouldn't reveal their implementation 
         details to anyone else (and shouldn't need to)

    - 5 key engineering principles. SOLID

      1. *Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)* 

         modules should only exist to serve one purpose and may only change if 
         that purpose is modified

      2. *Open/Closed Principle (OCP)*

         modules should be open for extension but closed to modification

      3. *Liskov Substitution Principle (DIP)*

         modules that inherit from a parent should not alter any of that 
         parent's functionality

      4. *Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)*

         each different user of a module should get to access it via a 
         specialized interface that only requires them to supply the minimal 
         amount of information

      5. *Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)*

         higher level modules should dictate the implementation details of lower
         level modules, not the other way around
